			<h2><span>Preface</span></h2>
			<h3><span>Once upon a time...</span></h3>
			<p><i>
					Toys are the forgotten significance. It holds a substantial memorial. It became a mystic item,
					as
					the
					years passed. The dust, a remnant of a different life.</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				It’s early 2000. We visited grandma. She lived in a flat, build in the post-second war in the
				Netherlands. I still remember the smell of the staircases in the concrete hallways. It smelled
				wet,
				and
				old, yet musky and nice.

				<br>
				<br>

				My grandma lived on her own in this little apartment. Her husband - my grandfather and my
				father's
				father - died already a long time ago. I have never met him in my life.
				Her apartment was chic yet old-fashioned decorated. The dark wooden furniture is accentuated
				with
				crochet doilies with flowers. Even the television furniture got blessed by a crochet doily, just
				like
				her coffee table and the radiator.
				<br>
				<br>
				You would hear always the following sounds. Ticking from the golden clock, which was held by a
				white
				sculpture of a woman. A Christian choir, sung on the television. The tones of a little silver
				spoon,
				stirring the cup of coffee of my father. Because he was the only one who drinks his coffee with
				milk
				and
				sugar. And of course; the sound of my grandma talking. The most imperative sound, which made it
				my
				grandma’s apartment. Because she could talk a lot.
				<br>
				<br>

				These memories of my grandma’s apartment are still strong till this day. And I know exactly why.
				There wasn’t much to play with. So I often found myself being in the moment or daydreaming away.
				By
				looking at one of the paintings in the house, for example. In the hallway there was a painting
				of
				two
				women, sitting, almost lying, casually at the beach, looking at the beholder. It looks like a
				painting
				made in the 1800s.
				<br>
				<br>
				‘If I look away, maybe they will move?’ ‘What would they talk about?’
				There was also a fake Rembrandt in her house. An image of Titus as a child, the son of
				Rembrandt. I
				had
				a little crush on him. Because he had curls and sweet eyes. Which is still my kinda type. Now it
				hangs
				in my room while I type these words.
				<br>
				<br>

				Then there was this huge closet in another room of my grandma’s apartment. You can easily call
				it
				‘the
				Closet to the realm of Narnia’. From the Novels of C. S. Lewis. A fantasy world of magic,
				mythical
				beasts, and talking animals. The closet was made of a glossy type of wood and felt monstrous. As
				it
				curled up at the ceiling. I could eat me up, if my parents and my grandma wouldn’t pay close
				enough
				attention.
				<br>
				<br>

				But suddenly, my dad came up to me with a huge brown suitcase. Filled with little railroads,
				plastic
				horses, pigs, cows, trains and cars. It wasn’t much, but it felt as if I made a mystic journey
				back
				to
				the 60s. When my dad was just as old, as I was then; playing on the carpet at my grandma’s
				place.
				Hearing the same clock, the Christian choir singing on the radio, surrounded by the same
				paintings.
				Maybe his dad was stirring the same cup of coffee with the same little silver spoon as my dad
				did in
				my
				childhood.

			<h3><span>Faith in Toys</span></h3>
			<p>
				My relationship with toys has always been something mystic. Dreams, imagination, play, and magic.
				The combination of the unconscious, conscious, and uncertainty glide us into a world where fantasy
				becomes as true as we want them to be. Toys were always a part of human nature and human spirit and
				- presumably - existing thousands – if not millions of years. With archaeological records from the
				graves Palaeolithic children, researchers and scientist are speculating about the grave goods and
				offerings that have been found. From jewelry of shell and ivory beads and pierced teeth to tools and
				small carvings of animals. <a id="footnr"
					href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-31/old-toys-prehistoric-society-children-archaeology-anthropology/9493204">[1]</a>
				With no
				direct proof, we can only imagine how a kid in
				the
				prehistoric
				age could have interact with the carving of an animal. Maybe within our own imagination, we
				might
				find proof from our own abilities of play and fantasy.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>If we can do it, they did it probably as well.</i>
				<br>
				<br>

				In an earlier work <a id="popupimage" href="blabla"> “the relic” (2021) </a> </div>, I was discovering
				my own
				history and sense I had with
				toys.
				This became a symmetrical relic in which you can find toys from my parents and myself. In the
				center
				you would find a statue of Mother Maria. Raised catholic, I learned about faith from a young
				age.
				From here I started to create my own faith - or myths as you can call it. To discover what I
				want to
				be, discovering my own morals and exploring my ability to daydream into worlds, situations with
				the
				perspective of various characters, in different forms, with their own unique created
				personalities.
				The relic became an ode to all these adventures my parents and I had with the toys we chose to
				keep.
				These toys sparked us, unlike the toys we gave away. Like old friends we left behind. We
				probably
				will notice how much we missed them, until we find them again.
				<br>
				<br>
				As my collection of toys are now just starting to be organized and archived, I also started to
				investigate into toy collectors and their philosophies and relationships they have with their
				toys.
				Why do they collect toys? What is the difference between an art collector and a toy collector?
				What
				is the meaning of toys?

			<h3><span>Chapter 1</span></h3>
			<h2><span>The Toys </span></h2>
			<h3><span>The History</span></h3>

			<p>
				My relationship with toys has always been something mystic. Dreams, imagination, play, and magic.
				The combination of the unconscious, conscious, and uncertainty glide us into a world where fantasy
				becomes reality. Toys, like the play itself, serve multiple purposes in both humans and animals. As
				we, humans, could kick a ball, a dog would try to chase it. Toys are part of nature. As of today,
				many items are manufactured to serve as toys, there are items and/or materials for other purposes
				that can also be used as toys. I mean, what kind of games and play can you come up with, with only
				sticks and stones?
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>
					“Play is the highest development in childhood, for it alone is the free expression of what is in the
					child’s soul…. children’s play is not a mere sport. It is full of meaning and import.”
				</i> Fröbel said.
				<br>
				<br>
				Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel was a German educator. He is the founder of the first kindergarten,
				in 1837 in Bad Blankenburg. It was an institute for children under the age of six, which he occupied
				with all sorts of self-invented works that he considered instructive. For example, the folding of
				paper. Children would become acquainted with geometric forms. This kind of play resulted in one of
				the most known toys to children; the block box. Something what would give a huge influence on some
				“rebels” in Germany, 100 years later. Which made these wooden toys popular till this day. More on
				this later. Because let’s go back, way – way – way back. Because where or when did the invention of
				toys start? How was the relation between children and toys throughout the years? And what made the
				toys so cultural popular and how?
				<br>
				<br>
				I will start this with a straight up answer:
				The origin of toys is found in the doll. Our ancestors began to create dolls to give to the new
				infant. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and
				Rome. Which would be around 2000BC. The dolls had wigs and movable limbs which were made from stone,
				clay, sticks, wax and wood. These dolls were blessed with a protective mimic spirit to confuse the
				evil spirits.
				<br>
				<br>

				Figure 1 Paddle Doll,
				ca. 2008-1630 B.C.E.
				Wood, mud, flax, faience, pigment, (20.3 x 5.2 cm).
				Like in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, children also played with bows and arrows, and yo-yos. When
				Greek children, especially girls, came of age it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of
				their childhood to the gods. On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer
				their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬. Here we already see the toy
				in a ritual manner. I will go more extensive about this topic in Faith and Collecting Repiques.
				Until the first millennia, toys were to embody spiritualism, superstition and ritual, instead to
				comfort and joy as we know today
				<br>
				<br>
				Toys were also important during the medieval era. This was also the time that toys, as term, got
				documented. With my own hypothesis due to the upcoming of book pressing. Various historians and
				archaeologists have been able to demonstrate the reflecting matter of the relationships between
				parents and children in these times A large majority of toys from this era were made from decaying
				materials like wood, wax, cloth, or even grass. As such most would have decomposed leaving little
				evidence for the archaeological record, although some toys did survive.
				The toys of princes and the high nobility were, not surprisingly, of better quality and thus more
				likely to be well preserved. With the highly craftsmanship, suggesting the owners of these toys were
				valued individuals. Most toys for princes were also related to the art of warfare to prepare them
				for what was considered to be their main task in adult life.
				And sick children could be given toys to pass the time and make them feel better as for Charles VII,
				future king of France, who fell ill at the age of 2 in 1404 and was given a toy cauldron to play
				with. Although he was a prince, poorer parents must have behaved similarly with less expensive toys
				to the extent of their means.
				<br>
				<br>
				Figure 2 Hortus Deliciarum, Childeren playing with a knight game, end of the 12th century

				Throughout the first quarter of the 20th Century, most toys were made in Germany. German toys were
				often made of wood. Hand carving was commonplace and considered manufacturing. Because remember the
				“rebels” I told you about? Those were the students and graduates of the Bauhaus. Alma
				Siedhoff-Buscher gave a fresh new breath to the block box that was developed from the plays of
				Frobel.
				<br>
				<br>
				Did you know that the Teddy Bear was invented in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt? It all began
				when Theodore Roosevelt was on a bear hunting trip near Onward, Mississippi on November 14, 1902.

				As the mass production still had to start (1920’s) many of these toys either had to be skillfully
				made at home or else they could cost quite a bit of money. In 1900’s, toys for children were more
				uncommon than we might think. Child labor was more common to children, than it was to play. Some as
				young as 4, worked in factories, mines, fields, canneries, and tenement sweatshops. This was seen in
				any country where the industrialization was in its peek. The commonplace was that 18% of all
				American workers in 1900, were under the age of 16
				<br>
				<br>
				“All caused by sheer poverty, by the poverty of parents, by the ambition of parents and by the
				ignorance of parents as well as by the law of market which demands that a product be turned out a
				the least possible cost to sell at the highest possible price” Jane Addams stated in 1914
				<br>
				<br>
				Ignorance was seen mostly seen in the religious poor parents. As there was no
				birth control, many children lived in poor environments, with strict regulations and little
				needed provisions. Toys were seen as impractical – even idiotic for a child to spend its time
				with, when it could earn money and pray to god. The children, who were lucky enough to own and
				play with store brought toys, were children from the wealthy adults. They were carefully made of
				wood or ivory. Think of rocking horses, a rolling hoop, marbles, bilboquet (a cup and ball game)
				and phenakistiscope (where an animation will be played when you spin it between your palms).
				<br>
				<br>
				During this same period French bisque dolls with swivel heads and movable arms, legs, and eyes,
				started to occur in newspapers. This made the start of advertisement to trigger psychological
				urges to bond a child with their make -believe friends and imaginary siblings. Scan in images of
				the advertisements at these times Image phenakistiscope Mass production went to full glory after
				WWII ended, the economy was rising, and the baby boomers populated the world. By the 1950s,
				manufacturers quickly caught on to the idea that wealthier families would buy an entirely new
				set of clothing, toys and other gadgets on the way toys were positioned in the marketplace. Like
				television, which brought in celebrity and character tie-ins to build new toy brands from. The
				postwar generation was easy seduced, and parents were composed to consume. Gasmasker speelgoed
				advertentie More varation of advertisement of toys. This was the time that fantasy, joy and
				comfort were fully capitalized. As magic now also had a place to pay for; in 1955, Walt Disney
				opened Disneyland Park. Later you had Barbie with more friends and toys with stories lines, that
				made children almost obliged to follow new fantasy experiences. Fantasy was made and created for
				you – by capitalism. Important to note is that most – if not all - advertisement until 1960 were
				promoted with white children. From 1970 advertisement showed the first black children, which
				became way more frequently leading to the 1980’s. 1970 advertisement In the 1980’s and 1990’s
				nostalgia from the toys, before big chain stores were dominating the market, were prompted. An
				no wonder… This is the time when baby boomers were adults and wanted to evoke the spirit they
				felt when they were a child in the 1940’s and 1950’s. This was also, of course, capitalized. Now
				every generation after the baby boomers, even me, as Generation Z, will search to the spirit of
				one self as child found in toy we once played with and probably need to pay for.

			<h3><span>Chapter 2</span></h3>
			<h2><span>The Portal to Faith</span></h2>
			<h3><span>Philosophies on toys </span></h3>

			<p>
				From the History of Magic by Chris Gosden:
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>
					“Magic is not a set of outmoded beliefs for the credulous, the ill-educated, the stupid or
					the
					mad. Magic is not even something to which people resort but rather is a prominent feature in
					many lives. Magic encourages a holistic view of human beings, linking them to the planet
					through
					practical and moral relationships. At a time when we need positive and holistic planetary
					thinking, magic has much to offer.”
				</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				My father was from a protestant family. My mother was from a catholic family. I wouldn’t say
				that faith was the center of my raising, but I was definitely within the environment of faith.
				In my elementary school, we always started the day with praying, followed by the stories from
				the bible. We listened to beautiful stories, full of spectacles. We learn about morals; what is
				good and what not. Nevertheless, I mainly learned a lot about storytelling and unlimited
				imagination.
				<br>
				<br>
				With my own experience what faith could mean in broadly documented religions, I start to make my
				own equations. These connections aren’t too odd either. Different cultural philosophers have
				been making such fundamental connections. Johan Huizinga (1872 - 1945) coined the term ‘Homo
				ludens’ in his seminal work (of the same name) to describe our species, seeing play, ritual and
				performance as fundamentally interrelated throughout our human activities. Furthermore, there is
				also a long history of scholars studying play behaviors in animals and humans. To propose that
				play contributes a huge factor to cognitive development, behavioral innovation and creativity.
				Which is eventually essential to the development of social norms, such as moral behavior and
				concepts of fairness. Sounds all quite recognizable; they are all components of religious
				thought and ritual behaviors.
				<br>
				<br>
				As you would know now, until the first millennial AC, toys were to embody spiritualism,
				superstition, and ritual I do believe that the spiritualism has never left the toy. No matter
				which era they got produced. They become a portal to a world where we have the control. The god
				of our own fantasies. The toys are alive, if only you will let them… right?
				My grandma gave me a porcelain doll once. I couldn’t really play with her. Handmade and full of
				care. It looked so refined to me, that I didn’t even dare to touch the craftmanship. The doll
				looked as if she could move any moment, just like the paintings, the huge wooden closet, the
				white sculpture of the woman, holding the golden clock and the duplicated painting of Titus from
				Rembrandt. It felt that anything my grandma owned, had spirit.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>
					The eyes of the doll were wide open as if she could look right in me, to take my spirit and
					distort my imaginations. I slept on a high bed, the doll got placed by my father on the high
					closet – facing me in the night. I feared the doll, yet I was too polite to say anything
					about
					the omen... It was gift of grandma and I saw how fond she was of giving one of her favorite
					toys
					to me.
					One night, I believe she moved. Or she opened and closed her eyes. As it was not an “it” nor
					it
					was really a “she”. The doll wasn’t alive. But the magic, the myth, the spirit was.
				</i>
				<br>
				<br>
				All these magic, ideas, and beliefs made us who we are. The toys were our idols, our teachers,
				and the caretakers of our life. From the blocks, cars, figures, dolls, and games to the
				complicated construction sets. But then we get conflicted… with life. Full of embarrassments,
				peer pressure, heart break, responsibilities, career, loneliness, and death. Not able to face
				our fears, yet unconscious feeding them at the same time, we flee to media, filled with bad
				news, gossips, trends to keep up, tips and tricks how to live your life. Swiftly, we find
				ourselves being a teenager, a young adult, an adult, an elderly. We lost some of our friends
				along the way, for the good and for the better. We have done the same with our toys. Lost,
				forgotten, or maybe still close with us.
				<br>
				<br>
				You might just read a deep analysis of the movie trilogy: Toys Story. A trilogy that grew with
				his audience, just as the toys did in the movie. From Toy Story 1 we find a childlike story of
				Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll, becoming jealous of new Buzz Lightyear space figure. Woody
				tries to dispose Buzz, which ultimately backfires to him. A story you as a kid could recognize,
				as kids can’t gasp the consequence and responsibilities, that can happen when they hurt someone
				in acts of feeling jealousy.
				<br>
				<br>
				Throughout the trilogy, the toys in Toy Story are facing more difficult themes. As Toy Story 2
				faces teenage problems, like, figuring out what is true meaning is of friendship. Toy Story 3
				symbolizing the young adult, with going to college and having anxiety about our future. And Toy
				Story 4, being a full-on adult, parental responsibility (yes, the toys have kids now), and
				facing a midlife crisis. Toy Story catches on something, that I hold dear; The toys we play
				with, is the spirit within ourselves. Thou are the spark. The toys are us.
				<br>
				<br>
				Stuart Hall, a cultural theorist who brought huge influences on different sociologists,
				theorists and artists with his publication ‘Representation: Cultural Representation and
				Signifying Practices’, believes that, in how we think, what we say, think and feel about them–
				how we represent them– give them a meaning. And with the given framework of interpretation, we
				give meaning to objects, people and events. We create stories, we tell stories, create images,
				produce them, associate the emotions with them, classify them, and conceptualize them with the
				values we place on them. And this meaning, is what gives us a sense of our own identity. Of whom
				we are, where we belong, which path we must take to find joy, happiness and meaning.
				<br>
				<br>
				But we still don’t have the answer on what happens within us as soon we got our old forgotten
				toy back. I could give you different speculations to different situations. You could first
				question the person and what their value and relationship is towards the toy. Is it for
				investment? Is it to show off? Is it to find peace towards yourself as a kid? Or is it even
				something outside-in the toy itself? Is it to belong to a greater community? A portal to find
				love and acceptance?

				<br>
				It can feel quite bittersweet, knowing that our storytelling could be based on the fabrications

				non-creative by following these made-up stories? Oh, definitely not!
				<br>
				<br>
				My Little Pony, Barbie and Marvel Superheroes - just to name a couple - are all toys with huge
				franchises, from high-end movies, posters and merchandise. All presenting the same
				personalities,
				characteristics, that is picked for each figure. Nonetheless without these collective adventures
				on
				these toys, there wasn’t these huge communities of people where people could speculate, create
				conspiracy theories, write fanfictions, make drawings and even helping each other out throughout

				The My Little Pony fandom, maybe one of the strongest fandoms (and most bullied outside the
				community), got its fandom-boost from the animated television series that got produced by Hasbro
				as
				part of the My Little Pony toy franchise. Tied in with the 2010 relaunch of dolls and play sets,
				it
				found a large audience of male adult internet users in late 2010 and early 2011, forming a whole
				subculture called the “Bronies”, a portmanteau of "bro" and "pony”. We can think about how this
				franchise, which was actually target to young girls with their stereotypical “girly” image full
				of
				glitters, rainbows and pastel colors, got mainly loved by the male adult internet users.
				<br>
				<br>
				If we look into the reddit post of someone asking the community about how they got into My
				Little
				Pony, most of the answers talk about “started watching it as a joke” “I lost a bet and I had to
				watch 6 episodes of My Little Pony”, “wanted to know why people hated it”, and even user
				‘Dolphin_handjobs’ (yes, that is their username) talks about watching it as therapy. To feel
				accepted to be able to like friendly pastel ponies. These fandoms created space for emotions and
				love, which was rejected before due to toxic masculine ideology. They found freedom.
				<br>
				<br>
				With the blessing of the internet, anyone can search to the communities that are connected to
				the
				different toy franchises. In all these forms, we find creativity, kindness and discussions about
				the
				different figures and its actions.
				<br>
				<br>
				With all these stories in mind, having a community to find belonging; we can almost say we have
				found a new religion. The praying might just be daydreams and the fanfictions we tell each
				other.
				The rituals are by playing. And the toy… being the relic; holding the myths and magics, safe, frozen in
				time, probably on a high shelve or in a glass cabinet.

			<h3><span>Chapter 4</span></h3>
			<h2><span>Queen of my Castle</span></h2>
			<h3><span>Communities of toys</span></h3>
			<p>
				People start to collect toys. Why so?
				<br>
				<br>
				Neurologists and psychoanalysts all have their different theories on why people collect objects. Sigmund
				Freud even making the bold reasoning that it is all due to bad potty training. It was such traumatic
				experience to a child, dealing with something so disgusting and now they want to gain control of their
				own gathering. Other theories from Freud tell us more about collecting as protection against death by
				creating something that will live on after you are gone. A collection to give forward to next
				generations, as you would live forever. Becoming immortal.
				<br>
				<br>
				On the other hand, Carl Jung, believes that the collector sees the world as something too large, hostile
				and beyond their control. The collector wants to gain control by creating their own smaller world. By
				acquiring, arranging and protecting items on their own way. To feel a sense of mastery and satisfaction
				in the tiny world within a world. To be a ruler, emperor, lord, boss, king – a queen of their own
				castle, filled with kindness, comfort, to their own pleasure, amusement and peace of mind.
				<br>
				<br>
				Psychoanalyst and art historian, Werner Muensterberger goes further on this theory. He written a whole
				magnum opus about collecting behavior: “Collecting: An Unruly Passion” (1994) He tells us that it had to
				do with the infant being separated from its mother and forever searched for security within objects.
				Like a teddy bear or a blanket. From these temporary feelings of comfort, the infant grew up as an adult
				and tents to keep searching to objects to gain the temporary relief from difficult feelings. Like
				anxiety, loneliness and uncertainty. The feeling of comfort fades away and the collector must continue
				to add to the collection to avoid these negative feelings.
				<br>
				<br>
				With all these different theories, they eventually all blame a flaw in the upbringing of a child. Yet it
				doesn’t really gasp the whole meaning of what a collector is. As one might find value into rubber ducks,
				My Little Pony figures, another finds value into paintings or NFT’s. You could question; Was the NFT
				collector struggling with bad potty training? Did the rubber duck collector grow up without a mom?
				<br>
				<br>
				It isn’t all so black and white being a collector, as some neurologist and psychoanalysts from the 20th
				century have claimed. Eventually is has to do with the specific value that has been set by the
				environment it’s been presented in. We learn this from the book ‘Interpreting objects and collections’
				edited by Susan M. Pearce.
				<br>
				<br>

				They argue that any cultural object has three types of meaning. If we look into the graphic from
				‘Interpreting objects and collections’ we see these three types of meaning. On top we see: ‘range of
				possibility’. This is where the object that gets involved in exchanges of matter, energy and
				information. With the theme ‘toys’ in mind, we can look at this as the given environment a kid is
				surrounded in. We can think about religion, the wealth, geographical. These give our social
				characteristics, personal feelings and religious beliefs. This all, has influence on the given toys
				towards the kid. Play and roleplay starts from here.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then we go to the second meaning: ‘Langue’. This is the given meaning in the context of language, code
				and signage. For example, if we look to a ball, we know the difference between a basketball, a football,
				a skippyball, and a bouncing ball. From the materials, colors, the context the object plays a roll,
				gives us the meaning of this ‘ball’. In the first meaning of the ‘range of possibility’ we can try to
				football with a skippyball. But within the second meaning, we learn about ‘original’ usage of the
				object.
				<br>
				<br>
				Then we go to ‘Parole’. That is where the secret castles, small worlds, various bubbles, hidden capsules
				and grand museums are in action. The collections of collectors. The history of collectors found its
				origin in the 16th and 17th century in Europe. Also called the ‘Cabinets of Curiosities’ or ‘Kunst- or
				Wunderkammer’. For different people in the elite, merchants, aristocrats, scholars it became quite a
				mode to start collecting various rare items in their cabinets – organizing and categorizing them in ways
				to create new fascinations. These collections were however quite private in the beginning. Mainly to
				create status to the owner of the ‘Wunderkammer’, but also to reflect the owners own world beliefs in
				science, philosophy, theology and imagination.
				<br>
				<br>
				Toy collectors all have their ‘Wunderkammer’. They believe in what they collect. They interact, make
				photographs, share it online, discuss it, trade it, and create value. A toy collector is the needed
				achiever of all our dreams and innocence. You wouldn’t know how much you missed your old forgotten toy,
				the love for pastel colored ponies, the hair you could brush of various barbie dolls, the expression of
				power what superhero’s mirror within you, until you see it (again).
				All collectors are the archivers of human spirit.

			<h3><span>Chapter 5</span></h3>
			<h2><span> The Everlasting Plastic Horses </span></h2>
			<h3><span>Epilogue</span></h3>
			<p>
				Toys helped us, not only to understand the world, but also to discover our own identity. From the
				ancient Greece till now, we all still have our strong spiritual relationships with our toys. They might
				be forgotten or lost, but whenever we interact to our old plushy, dusty figure, or any other toy, it
				will come back to life. It could be the memories; it could be something we never had. We will be roaming
				back in time of innocence. To be a child we once were.
				<br>
				<br>
				With the upcoming of mass production and the economic boom from the 1950’s, marketing and media started
				to create different stories, high produced movies and many franchises. All to uphold a world to
				fantasize and dream about with the given figurines and characters you could own and play with. Money had
				to keep rolling and new characters got introduced. New My Little Pony characters, an extra help for
				Superman and a BFF for Barbie. Fantasies could be something to be unlocked - if you had the money for
				it.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the 1980’s, nostalgia started to hit to the baby boomers 1980’s and old toys got back to the market.
				The adults wanted their toys back – as they might got lost into new believe systems; work, gossips,
				trends, responsibilities and death. Slowly fandom communities started to form between people with the
				same fantasy interests.
				<br>
				<br>
				As the fandoms were growing, just did the value of toys. Toys became collectables and the collectors
				became their own curator of their own small world. Organizing and categorizing them in ways to create
				new fascinations.
				<br>
				<br>
				With my research, I saw the urgency of the existence of toys. It’s life, it’s your myth, it’s its
				spirit, it’s gateways to connection between people by play. It’s love, communion and to be accepted as
				who you are. In all the ways your even haven’t discovered yet of yourself.
