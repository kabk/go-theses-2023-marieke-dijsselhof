				<h2>Preface</h2>
				<h3>Once upon a time...</h3>
				<p><i style="color: aliceblue; ">
						Toys are the forgotten significance. It holds a substantial memorial. It became a mystic item,
						as
						the
						years passed. The dust, a remnant of a different life.</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					It’s early 2000. We visited grandma. She lived in a flat, build in the post-second war in the
					Netherlands. I still remember the smell of the staircases in the concrete hallways. It smelled
					wet,
					and
					old, yet musky and nice.

					<br>
					<br>

					My grandma lived on her own in this little apartment. Her husband - my grandfather and my
					father's
					father - died already a long time ago. I have never met him in my life.
					Her apartment was chic yet old-fashioned decorated. The dark wooden furniture is accentuated
					with
					crochet doilies with flowers. Even the television furniture got blessed by a crochet doily, just
					like
					her coffee table and the radiator.
					<br>
					<br>
					You would hear always the following sounds. Ticking from the golden clock, which was held by a
					white
					sculpture of a woman. A Christian choir, sung on the television. The tones of a little silver
					spoon,
					stirring the cup of coffee of my father. Because he was the only one who drinks his coffee with
					milk
					and
					sugar. And of course; the sound of my grandma talking. The most imperative sound, which made it
					my
					grandma’s apartment. Because she could talk a lot.
					<br>
					<br>

					These memories of my grandma’s apartment are still strong till this day. And I know exactly why.
					There wasn’t much to play with. So I often found myself being in the moment or daydreaming away.
					By
					looking at one of the paintings in the house, for example. In the hallway there was a painting
					of
					two
					women, sitting, almost lying, casually at the beach, looking at the beholder. It looks like a
					painting
					made in the 1800s.
					<br>
					<br>
					‘If I look away, maybe they will move?’ ‘What would they talk about?’
					There was also a fake Rembrandt in her house. An image of Titus as a child, the son of
					Rembrandt. I
					had
					a little crush on him. Because he had curls and sweet eyes. Which is still my kinda type. Now it
					hangs
					in my room while I type these words.
					<br>
					<br>

					Then there was this huge closet in another room of my grandma’s apartment. You can easily call
					it
					‘the
					Closet to the realm of Narnia’. From the Novels of C. S. Lewis. A fantasy world of magic,
					mythical
					beasts, and talking animals. The closet was made of a glossy type of wood and felt monstrous. As
					it
					curled up at the ceiling. I could eat me up, if my parents and my grandma wouldn’t pay close
					enough
					attention.
					<br>
					<br>

					But suddenly, my dad came up to me with a huge brown suitcase. Filled with little railroads,
					plastic
					horses, pigs, cows, trains and cars. It wasn’t much, but it felt as if I made a mystic journey
					back
					to
					the 60s. When my dad was just as old, as I was then; playing on the carpet at my grandma’s
					place.
					Hearing the same clock, the Christian choir singing on the radio, surrounded by the same
					paintings.
					Maybe his dad was stirring the same cup of coffee with the same little silver spoon as my dad
					did in
					my
					childhood.

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<h3>Faith in Toys</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 0vw;">
					My relationship with toys has always been something mystic. Dreams, imagination, play, and magic.
					The combination of the unconscious, conscious, and uncertainty glide us into a world where fantasy
					becomes as true as we want them to be. Toys were always a part of human nature and human spirit and
					- presumably - existing thousands – if not millions of years. With archaeological records from the
					graves Palaeolithic children, researchers and scientist are speculating about the grave goods and
					offerings that have been found. From jewelry of shell and ivory beads and pierced teeth to tools and
					small carvings of animals. <a href="#toyss" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="toyss-ref">
					</a>

					With no
					direct proof, we can only imagine how a kid in
					the
					prehistoric
					age could have interact with the carving of an animal. Maybe within our own imagination, we
					might
					find proof from our own abilities of play and fantasy.
					<br>
					<br>
					<i>If we can do it, they did it probably as well.</i>

						“the
						relic” (2021) <img class="showme" url src="assets/images/relic.PNG" style="margin-left:2.75rem;"
							width="100%"> </a>, I was
					discovering
					my own
					history and sense I had with
					toys.
					This became a symmetrical relic in which you can find toys from my parents and myself. In the
					center you would find a statue of Mother Maria. Raised catholic, I learned about faith from a young
					age.
					From here I started to create my own faith - or myths as you can call it. To discover what I want to
					be,
					discovering my own morals and exploring my ability to daydream into worlds, situations with
					the perspective of various characters, in different forms, with their own unique created
					personalities. The relic became an ode to all these adventures my parents and I had with the toys we
					chose to keep.
					These toys sparked us, unlike the toys we gave away. Like old friends we left behind. We
					probably
					will notice how much we missed them, until we find them again.
					<br>
					<br>
					As my collection of toys are now just starting to be organized and archived, I also started to
					investigate into toy collectors and their philosophies and relationships they have with their
					toys.
					Why do they collect toys? What is the difference between an art collector and a toy collector?
					What
					is the meaning of toys?

					A toy is a tool that is practiced for life experiences. For kids to understand the world in a
					broader
					sense, discover their identity, help with cognition, learn cause and effect, explore relationships,
					become stronger physically, stimulate creativity, and practice skills needed in adulthood. We take
					on
					roles, speak and use body language to represent our character – or our own. We engage in verbal
					storytelling and act in the character’s world.

					Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel was a German educator. He is the founder of the first kindergaden or
					Kindergarten as spelt in German language, in 1837 in Bad Blankenburg. It was an institute for
					children
					under the age of six, which he occupied with all sorts of self-invented works that he considered
					instructive. For example, the folding of paper. Children would become acquainted with geometric
					forms.
					This kind of play resulted in one of the most known toys to children:
					<a class="showher" style="background-color: greenyellow; color: #ff68b3;" href="blabla">the block
						box.<img class="showme" url src="assets/images/froebel.jpg" style="width: 42vw;" width="80%"

						id="froebel-ref"></a> what
					would give a huge influence on some ‘rebels’ in Germany, 100 years later. Which made these wooden
					toys
					popular until this day. More on this later. Let’s go back. Where or when did the invention of toys
					start? How was the relation between children and toys throughout the years? And what made the toys
					so
					culturally popular and how?

				<h3 style="border-bottom: 0; color: aliceblue; padding-top: 40px;">Toys, as we know toys; <BR>It all
					began
					with the
					doll…</h3>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
					The origin of the meaning of toys is found in the doll. The earliest documented dolls go back to the
					ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Which would be around 2000BC. The dolls had wigs
					and
					movable limbs which were made from stone, clay, sticks, wax and wood. <a class=" showher"
						href="blabla" style="background-color: greenyellow; color: #ff68b3;">These
						dolls<img class="showme" url src="assets/images/AncientDoll.jpg" width="100%">
					</a> were blessed with a protective mimic spirit to confuse the evil spirits. They also created
					these
					dolls to give to the new
					infants. <a href="#dollss" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="dollss-ref"></a>
					<br>
					<br>
					In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, children also played with bows and arrows, and yo-yos. When
					Greek children, especially girls, came of age it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of
					their childhood to the gods. <a href="#history" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
						id="history-ref"></a> On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer
					their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood. Here we already see the toy in a ritual
					manner. I will go more extensive about this topic in Faith and Collecting Repiques. Until the first
					millennia AC, toys were to embody spiritualism, superstition and ritual, instead to comfort and joy
					as we know today.

					<br>
					<br>
					Toys were also important <a class="showher" style="background-color: greenyellow; color: #ff68b3;"
						href="blabla">during the medieval era.<img class="showme" url src="assets/images/Ridder.jpeg"
							style="width: 42vw;" width="80%" style="left: 20em;"></a>This was also the time
					that toys, as term, got documented. <a href="#word" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
						id="word-ref"></a>With my own hypothesis, this must be due to the upcoming of book
					pressing. Various
					historians and archaeologists have been able to demonstrate the reflecting matter of the
					relationships between parents and children in these times. <a href="#medieval"
						aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="medieval-ref"></a> A large majority of toys from this era
					were made from
					decaying materials like wood, wax, cloth, or even grass. As such most would have decomposed leaving
					little evidence for the archaeological record, although some toys did survive.
					<br>
					<br>

				</div>
				<p style="padding-bottom: 30px;">
					The toys of the young royalty and high nobility were, not surprisingly, of better quality and thus
					more likely to be well preserved. With the highly craftsmanship, suggesting the owners of these toys
					were
					valued individuals. Most toys for princes were also related to the art of warfare to prepare them
					for what was, considered to be, their main task in adult life. A playful introduction to war and
					reigning,
					that is.
					<br>
					<br>
					Moreover, sick children could be given toys to pass the time and make them feel better as for
					Charles
					VII, future king of France, who fell ill at the age of 2 in 1404 and was given a toy cauldron to
					play
					with.<a href="#medieval" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="medieval-ref"></a> Although he was a
					prince, poorer parents must have behaved similarly with less expensive toys
					to
					the extent of their means.

					<br>
					<br>
					Throughout the first quarter of the 20th Century, most toys were made in Germany. German toys were
					often
					made of wood. <a href="#1930" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="1930-ref"></a>Hand carving was
					commonplace and considered manufacturing. Because remember the
					“rebels” I
					told you about? Those were the students and graduates of the Bauhaus. Alma Siedhoff-Buscher gave a
					fresh
					new breath to the block box that was developed from the plays of Frobel.

					at
					the Bauhaus Dessau
					from 1922. She
					graduated
					in 1927. Since she started working in the woodwork shop, she created various child toys and puppet
					theaters. Some men weren’t always keen on her working on three-dimensional design and were better
					working with two-dimensional patterns in the Weaving Workshop. Walter Gropius, head of the Bauhaus,
					and
					often depicted as a visionary and architect or designer, was in fact quite a problematic figure when
					it
					came to the emancipatory project at the structuring of the curriculum of the Bauhaus, where women
					had to
					predominantly study textiles etc. and were not very welcome in the other classes such as engineering
					and
					architecture. (Always those men with their ‘opinions’) Alma designs are until this day praised by
					many
					designers. Stated by many: “a timeless design”.
					Unfortunately, Alma was later killed during an air raid during the WWII. She was 45. A woman with a
					life
					full of potential that was lost amongst so many.

					money
					since
					mass production had not yet started in the 1920s. In the 1900’s, toys for children were more
					uncommon
					than we might think. Unfortunately, child labor was more common to children, than it was to play.
					Some
					as young as four, worked in factories, mines, fields, canneries, and tenement sweatshops. This was
					seen
					in any country where industrialization was at its peak. The commonplace was that 18% of all American
					workers in 1900, were under the age of 16. <a href="#jane" aria-describedby="footnote-label"

					the Slinky. An

					transported through rough seas during World War II. But that didn’t work out. So he changed the
					meaning
					of the object into a toy. <a href="#slinky" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="slinky-ref"></a>

					After World War II ended and the economy was booming, mass production went into full swing and the
					baby
					boomer generation emerged. In the 1950s, manufacturers quickly realized that wealthier families
					would
					purchase an entirely new set of clothing, toys, and gadgets based on the way toys were positioned in
					the
					marketplace.
					<a class="showher" style="background-color: greenyellow; color: #ff68b3;" href="blabla">Television,
						<img class="showme" url src="assets/images/television.png" style="width: 22vw;" width="80%"
							style="left: 20em;"></a> for instance, brought in celebrity and character tie-ins to
					create new toy
					brands. Postwar kids had exposure to TV and radio commercials, as well as various toy advertisements
					in
					magazines and newspapers, while parents were encouraged to consume. This marks the birth of toys as
					we
					know them today, when fantasy, joy, and comfort were fully capitalized. As magic, imagination, and
					fantasy became commodities that had to be purchased, toy advertisements began to showcase new
					products,
					such as "Introducing! A new friend for Barbie!" and "A full collection of the adventures of King
					Kong!"
					These fantasies became options that could only be unlocked by buying them, creating a sense of
					obligation for children to experience new fantasies and for parents to purchase them.
					<br>
					<br>
					Until 1960, the advertising market exclusively featured white children in their advertisements and
					commercials, but this began to change in the 1970s with the first appearances of black children,
					which
					became more frequent in the 1980s. Interestingly, in 1980, the first Afro-American Barbie made its
					debut, albeit somewhat belatedly. It was designed by Louvenia "Kitty" Black Perkins, who became a
					legend
					among Barbie collectors and in the toy industry. Perkins guided the creative production team at
					Mattel,
					the world's largest toy manufacturer, for 25 years. She championed diversity and the exploration of
					new
					territories and themes. Perkins revealed that she never owned a Barbie during her childhood. Born in
					1948 and raised in the heavily segregated southern region of America, it was unlikely for a black
					girl
					to ask for a white doll. It is difficult to imagine discovering one's own desires and dreams with a
					toy
					that one cannot relate to. <a href="#blackbarbie" aria-describedby="footnote-label"

					A known contemporary artist, Hank Willis Thomas, made various works about the American advertisement
					and
					how it has historically perpetuated and reinforced racial and gender stereotypes. For example, his
					series "Unbranded: Reflections in Black by Corporate America" features advertisements from the
					mid-20th
					century that were targeted at Black consumers, with the brand names and logos removed. By removing
					the
					branding and focusing solely on the images, Thomas draws attention to the ways in which these ads
					relied
					on racist tropes and caricatures to sell products. With this work he challenges viewers to question
					the
					ways in which these images have been used to shape our understanding of race, gender, and identity,
					and
					encourages us to think critically about the messages that we are bombarded with on a daily basis.<a

					During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a resurgence of nostalgia for toys, which was prompted by the
					significant increase in the globalization of the world economy. This period was characterized by the
					growing interdependence of nations, the rise of multinational corporations, and the liberalization
					of
					trade and investment policies.
					<br>
					<br>
					One of the main drivers of globalization during the 1980s was the growth of international trade, as
					many
					countries began to open their markets to foreign competition, resulting in increased flows of goods
					and
					services across borders. The rise of container shipping and air transport also made it easier and
					cheaper to transport goods around the world. Combined with the fact that the baby boomers were
					becoming
					adults and wanted to evoke the spirit they had as children with their toys, a lot of toys were
					purchased. Now, every generation after the baby boomers, including myself as a member of Generation
					Z,
					will search for the spirit of their childhood found in the toys they once played with, and will
					likely
					have to pay for them. In fact, I recently bought myself a Nintendo DS Lite.
					<br>
					<br>
					I truly believe that this is the circle of the toy. We play with them, forget about them, begin to
					feel
					nostalgic, and then want them back. But what happens as soon as we get them back?
					<br>
					<br>
					Overall toys have also played a significant role in shaping our understanding of gender norms
					throughout
					the years. However, it is important to note that now over time, these norms have become less rigid
					and
					more fluid. One example of gender norms in toys between boys and girls in earlier times is the
					Barbie
					doll, which was introduced in 1959 and quickly became a popular toy for girls. The Barbie doll was
					marketed as the idealized feminine beauty, with her slim figure, blonde hair, and fashionable
					clothes.
					In contrast, toys for boys often emphasized action and strength, such as toy soldiers, cars, and
					construction sets. As society continues to evolve, we are seeing a shift towards a more inclusive
					and
					accepting approach to gender expression, particularly in the realm of toys. While there is still
					much
					work to be done in terms of breaking down gender stereotypes and promoting equality, the progress
					that
					has been made thus far is a positive step towards a more open and diverse world. <a href="#gendered"

				<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
				<h2>The Portal to Faith</h2>
				<h3>Philosophies on toys </h3>

				<p>
					From the History of Magic by Chris Gosden:
					<br>
					<br>
					<i style="color: aliceblue;">
						“Magic is not a set of outmoded beliefs for the credulous, the ill-educated, the stupid or
						the
						mad. Magic is not even something to which people resort but rather is a prominent feature in
						many lives. Magic encourages a holistic view of human beings, linking them to the planet
						through
						practical and moral relationships. At a time when we need positive and holistic planetary
						thinking, magic has much to offer.”
					</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					My father came from a Protestant family, while my mother came from a Catholic family. Although faith
					was
					not necessarily the core focus of my upbringing, I was certainly raised in an environment that
					emphasized it. At my elementary school, we began each day with a prayer, followed by stories from
					the
					Bible. We were exposed to beautiful narratives that were often rich in spectacle. Through these
					stories,
					we learned about morality and what constitutes right and wrong. However, above all else, I was able
					to
					glean a great deal about the art of storytelling and the power of imagination.

					Based on my own experiences and observations of broadly documented religions, I have started to make
					my
					own connections and equations. These connections are not too unusual, as many cultural philosophers
					have
					also made fundamental connections. One such philosopher is Johan Huizinga (1872-1945), who coined
					the
					term "Homo ludens" in his seminal work of the same name to describe our species. He saw play,
					ritual,
					and performance as fundamentally interrelated throughout our human activities.
					<br>
					<br>
					Additionally, there exists a lengthy history of scholars who have studied play behaviors in both
					animals
					and humans, proposing that play plays a significant role in cognitive development, behavioral
					innovation, and creativity, which are all crucial to the development of social norms such as moral
					behavior and concepts of fairness. These aspects sound quite familiar and are all components of
					religious thought and ritual behaviors.
					<br>
					<br>
					As you now know, toys were once created to embody spiritualism, superstition, and ritual until the
					first
					millennium AC. I believe that spiritualism has never truly left toys, regardless of the era in which
					they were produced. They serve as portals to worlds where we have control, becoming the gods of our
					own
					fantasies. Toys are alive, if only we allow them to be.

					<br>
					<br>
					<i style="color: aliceblue; line-height: 1.2em;">
						The eyes of the doll were wide open as if she could look right in me, to take my spirit and
						distort my imaginations. I slept on a high bed, the doll got placed by my father on the high
						closet – facing me in the night. I feared the doll, yet I was too polite to say anything
						about
						the omen... It was gift of grandma and I saw how fond she was of giving one of her favorite
						toys
						to me.
						One night, I believe she moved. Or she opened and closed her eyes. As it was not an “it” nor
						it
						was really a “she”. The doll wasn’t alive. But the magic, the myth, the spirit was.
					</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					All of the magic, beliefs, and ideas that surrounded our toys shaped who we are today. They were our
					idols, our teachers, and our guardians. From simple blocks, cars, and figures to intricate
					construction
					sets and dolls, they helped us navigate the world. But as we grew older, life became more
					complicated.
					We faced embarrassment, peer pressure, heartbreak, responsibility, loneliness, and death. Unable to
					confront our fears, we turned to media for distraction and guidance, filling our minds with bad
					news,
					gossip, and trends. We became teenagers, young adults, adults, and eventually, the elderly. Along
					the
					way, we lost friends and toys alike, either forgotten or left behind.
					<br>
					<br>
					This analysis may remind you of the Toy Story trilogy, which evolved alongside its audience, much
					like
					the toys in the films. In the first installment, Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll, becomes jealous
					of
					the new Buzz Lightyear figure and attempts to dispose of him. The consequences of his actions serve
					as a
					lesson for children about the responsibilities and consequences of jealousy.

					Throughout the trilogy, the toys confront increasingly complex issues. In Toy Story 2, they grapple
					with
					teenage problems such as discovering the true meaning of friendship. Toy Story 3 depicts young
					adulthood, with characters facing anxiety about their future as they prepare for college. Toy Story
					4
					explores the challenges of parenthood and midlife crisis. These films touch on a universal truth
					that I
					hold dear: the toys we play with are a reflection of ourselves. They embody our spirit and spark,
					and
					serve as a reminder of who we are.
					<br>
					<br>
					Stuart Hall, an influential cultural theorist who impacted sociologists, theorists and artists with
					his
					publication ‘Representation: Cultural Representation and Signifying Practices’, believes that, in
					how we
					think, what we say, think and feel about them (the objects)– how we represent them– give them a
					meaning.
					And with the given framework of interpretation, we give meaning to objects, people and events. We
					create
					stories, we tell stories, create images, produce them, associate the emotions with them, classify
					them,
					and conceptualize them with the values we place on them. And this meaning, is what gives us a sense
					of
					our own identity. Of whom we are, where we belong, which path we must take to find joy, happiness
					and
					meaning.
					<br>
					<br>
					However, the question remains unanswered regarding what happens within us when we are reunited with
					an
					old, forgotten toy. Various speculations can be made based on different situations. One might
					initially
					question the person and their attitude towards the toy - is it considered an investment, a status
					symbol, a means to find inner peace as one recalls their childhood memories? Or does the answer lie
					in
					something beyond the toy itself - a desire to belong to a larger community or a portal to seek love
					and
					acceptance?

					The My Little Pony fandom, maybe one of the strongest fandoms (and most bullied outside the
					community),
					got its fandom-boost from the animated television series that got produced by Hasbro as part of the
					My
					Little Pony toy franchise. Tied in with the 2010 relaunch of dolls and play sets, it found a large
					audience of male adult internet users in late 2010 and early 2011, forming a whole subculture called
					the
					“Bronies”, a portmanteau of "bro" and "pony”. <a href="#mlp" aria-describedby="footnote-label"
						id="mlp-ref"></a> We can contemplate how a franchise that was originally
					aimed at young girls with a stereotypical "girly" image, complete with glitters, rainbows, and
					pastel
					colors, has primarily captured the attention and admiration of male adult internet users.
					<br>
					<br>
					If we look into the reddit post of someone asking the community about how they got into My Little
					Pony,
					most of the answers talk about “started watching it as a joke” “I lost a bet and I had to watch 6
					episodes of My Little Pony”, “wanted to know why people hated it”, and even user ‘Dolphin_handjobs’
					(yes, that is their username) talks about watching it as therapy. To feel accepted to be able to
					like
					friendly pastel ponies. <a href="#mlp2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="mlp2-ref"></a> These
					fandoms created space for emotions and love, which was rejected before
					due
					to toxic masculine ideology. The “bronies” found a new freedom, while being surrounded with people
					who
					found themselves stuck too in the masculine ideology.

					With the blessing of the internet, anyone can search to the communities that are connected to the
					different toy franchises. In all these forms, we find creativity, kindness and discussions about the

				<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
				<h2>Queen of my Castle</h2>
				<h3>Communities of toys</h3>
				<p>
					People start to collect toys. Why so?
					<br>
					<br> Neurologists and psychoanalysts all have different theories on why people collect objects.
					Sigmund
					Freud even made the bold claim that it is all due to bad potty training. It was such a traumatic
					experience for a child dealing with something so disgusting, and now they want to gain control of
					their
					own gathering. <a href="#gathering" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="gathering-ref"></a> Other
					theories from Freud tell us more about collecting as protection against death
					by
					creating something that will live on after you are gone, a collection to give forward to the next
					generation, as you would live forever and become immortal.
					<br>
					<br>
					On the other hand, Carl Jung believes that the collector sees the world as something too large,
					hostile,
					and beyond their control. The collector wants to gain control by creating their own smaller world.
					By
					acquiring, arranging, and protecting items in their own way, they feel a sense of mastery and
					satisfaction in the tiny world within a world, to be a ruler, emperor, lord, boss, king - or queen -
					of
					their own castle filled with kindness, comfort, pleasure, amusement, and peace of mind.
					<br>
					<br>
					Psychoanalyst and art historian Werner Muensterberger goes further into this theory. He wrote a
					whole
					magnum opus about collecting behavior: “Collecting: An Unruly Passion” (1994). He tells us that it
					has
					to do with the infant being separated from its mother and forever searching for security within
					objects,
					like a teddy bear or a blanket. From these temporary feelings of comfort, the infant grew up as an
					adult
					and tends to keep searching for objects to gain temporary relief from difficult feelings like
					anxiety,
					loneliness, and uncertainty. The feeling of comfort fades away, and the collector must continue to
					add
					to the collection to avoid these negative feelings.
					<br>
					<br>
					With all these different theories, they eventually all blame a flaw in the upbringing of a child.
					Yet it
					doesn’t really grasp the whole meaning of what a collector is. As one might find value in rubber
					ducks
					or My Little Pony figures, another finds value in paintings or NFTs. You could question, was the NFT
					collector struggling with bad potty training? Did the rubber duck collector grow up without a mom?
					<br>
					<br>
					It isn’t all so black and white being a collector, as some neurologists and psychoanalysts from the
					20th
					century have claimed. Eventually, it has to do with the specific value that has been set by the
					environment it’s been presented in. We learn this from the book ‘Interpreting objects and
					collections’
					edited by Susan M. Pearce.
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="assets/images/Scheme.png"

					<br>
					<br>
					They argue that any cultural object has three types of meaning. If we look into the graphic from
					‘Interpreting objects and collections,’ we see these three types of meaning. On top, we see ‘range
					of
					possibility.’ This is where the object gets involved in exchanges of matter, energy, and
					information.
					With the theme ‘toys’ in mind, we can look at this as the given environment a kid is surrounded in.
					We
					can think about religion, wealth, geography. These give our social characteristics, personal
					feelings,
					and religious beliefs. This all has influence on the given toys towards the kid. Play and roleplay
					start
					from here.
					Then we go to the second meaning: ‘Langue.’ This is the given meaning in the context of language,
					code,
					and signage. For example, if we look at a ball, we know the difference between a basketball, a
					football,
					a skippy ball, and a bouncing ball. From the materials, colors, and context the object plays a role,
					we
					get the meaning of this ‘ball.’ In the first meaning of the ‘range of possibility,’ we can try to
					play
					football with a skippy ball. But within the second meaning, we learn about the ‘original’ usage of
					the
					object.

					Then we move on to 'Parole'. This is where secret castles, small worlds, various bubbles, hidden
					capsules, and grand museums come to life - the collections of collectors. The history of collecting
					can
					be traced back to the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, when the Cabinets of Curiosities or Kunst-
					or
					Wunderkammer emerged. For different people in the elite, merchants, aristocrats, and scholars, it
					became
					a trend to collect rare and unusual items in their cabinets, organizing and categorizing them in
					ways
					that created new fascinations. However, these collections were initially quite private, mainly
					serving
					to demonstrate the owner's status and reflect their beliefs in science, philosophy, theology, and
					imagination.

					Toy collectors all have their own Cabinet of Curiosities of some sort, a personal Wunderkammer.
					Probably, they believe in what they collect and interact with their collections by taking
					photographs,
					sharing them online, discussing them, trading them, and assigning value to them. Toy collectors are
					the
					keepers of (their) or our dreams and innocence. One may not realize how much they have missed their
					old
					forgotten toys, their love for pastel-colored ponies, the ability to brush the hair of various
					Barbie
					dolls, or the sense of power that superheroes instill until they see them again. All collectors are
					the
					archivists of the human spirit.

				<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
				<h2> The Everlasting Plastic Horses</h2>
				<h3>Epilogue</h3>


				<p>
					Toys have not only helped us to understand the world, but also to discover our own identity. From
					ancient times to the present day, we all still have a strong spiritual connection with our toys.
					Though
					they may be forgotten or lost, whenever we interact with our old plushies, dusty figures, or any
					other
					toy, they come back to life. It could be the memories they evoke or something we never had, but we
					find
					ourselves wandering back in time to our childhood innocence.

					With the rise of mass production and the economic boom of the 1950s, marketing and media started
					creating different stories, highly produced movies, and numerous franchises to uphold a world of
					fantasy
					and dreams with corresponding figurines and characters that one could own and play with. Money had
					to
					keep rolling, and new characters were introduced, including new My Little Pony characters, an extra
					helper for Superman, and a BFF for Barbie. Fantasies became something to unlock, but only if you had
					the
					money for it.
					<br>
					<br>
					Toys have shaped our understanding of gender norms, but they are becoming more inclusive over time.
					Society is evolving towards a more diverse and accepting approach to gender expression through toys.
					Progress has been made, but there is still work to do to break down gender stereotypes and promote
					equality.
					<br>
					<br>
					In the 1980s, nostalgia hit the baby boomers, and old toys made their way back to the market. With
					the
					motivation from globalization during the 1980s, adults wanted their toys back, as they had
					potentially
					been lost in new belief systems, work, gossip, trends, responsibilities, and death. Slowly, fandom
					communities started to form between people with the same fantasy interests.
					<br>
					<br>
					As the fandoms grew, so did the value of toys. Toys became collectibles, and collectors became
					curators
					of their own small worlds, organizing and categorizing them in ways to create new fascinations.
					Through my research, I have come to see the urgency of the existence of toys. They embody life,
					myth,
					spirit, and gateways to connections that are created between people through playing. They represent
					love, communion, and acceptance of who you are, in all the ways you may not have even discovered
					about
					yourself yet! In the neoliberal times, where individualism is emphasized, and people are expected to
					take responsibility for their own lives without relying on the support of the government. We are
					often
					told to prioritize efficiency and other market-driven ideas, and we are very busy. In this context,
					incorporating play and being playful as a way of operating can be extremely important. Despite the
					demands of modern life, embracing playfulness can have significant benefits and is worth
					considering.
